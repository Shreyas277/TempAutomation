<h3 align='centre'> Hello Everyone!! </h3>

Here , I was working on the project where I will calculate an hourly temperature-related data of any location on the globe for the entire last year 2023. Changes can be made to make the year of your choice.

Data was scrapped from the https://www.wunderground.com/ website.

As it is cumbersome to click multiple times the same button again and again and enter the suitable dates , the code was written to automate the process.

- First of all, Lets look into the requirements.sh . It's bash file which upon execution installs all the necesarry packages.Ensure all the files are in the same directory. Chromedriver package zip file **chromedriver-linux64.zip** has been attached by me. Unzip that file and copy all the files into the directory generated by unziping.
  >***chmod 755 requirements.sh***
  
  >***./requirements.sh***
  
  >***unzip chromedriver-linux64.zip***

- In the first programme **final_temp1.py** , we enter the name of the city and state of which Temperature data needs to be scrapped.The programme will output the link from where data would be scrapped.
  >***python3 final_temp1.py city state***
  
- Now taking the link from previous programme as input, we will execute the second python script that's **Final_Temperature.py**. These file will be executed 12 times in the bash script **final_temp.sh** for 12 different months. The programme loads the Temperature data of each and every day for the provided month. The programme 'final_temp2.py' can also be used to perform the same task and it completes the entire task within one go but demands high computing power.
  >***python3 Final_Temperature.py link***

As the data to be scrapped is massive in size, it was collected and preserved in the SupaBase Database. Inorder to access this facility you need to create the supabase account which can be done by going on https://supabase.com/ website.

Once the account is generated , create a project and add the url and keys of your project to the file **.env** . And create tables via table editor on the dashboard and give the names to the table in the format **Temp_{month_name}**. The video to generate the table can be viewed from https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables?queryGroups=database-method&database-method=dashboard&queryGroups=language&language=python

As the programmes will be executed the scrapped data will uploaded on our database on Supabase.
